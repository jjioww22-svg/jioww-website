# ⚡ FIX IN 3 STEPS (10 Minutes)

---

## Your Problem:

Your screenshot shows: **`www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml` = "Not Found"**

This means your deployment is MISSING the sitemap file!

---

## ✅ I Fixed 2 Critical Errors:

1. **vercel.json** - Was sending sitemap → index.html (FIXED!)
2. **_redirects** - You made it a folder again (FIXED!)

---

## 🚀 Do This NOW:

### Step 1: Download (2 minutes)
**Download ALL code from Figma Make**

Make sure you get:
- ✅ vercel.json (I just fixed it!)
- ✅ _redirects (now a file, not folder!)
- ✅ public/sitemap.xml
- ✅ public/robots.txt

### Step 2: Deploy (5 minutes)
**Deploy to Vercel**

- Push to GitHub → auto-deploy
- OR use Vercel CLI
- OR drag & drop in Vercel dashboard

Wait 3 minutes for deployment to finish.

### Step 3: Test (1 minute)
**Visit:** https://www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml

✅ **Should see XML code like:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.jioww.com/</loc>
```

❌ **If you still see "Not Found":**
- Files didn't deploy correctly
- Re-check your deployment
- Make sure `public/` folder is included

---

## 📋 Then Submit to Google:

Once sitemap.xml shows XML (not "Not Found"):

1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Click "Sitemaps"
3. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Submit"

---

## ⚠️ STOP Doing This:

**DON'T manually edit `_redirects` in Figma Make!**

Every time you do, Figma creates it as a FOLDER with TSX files.

Just download and deploy - it's already fixed!

---

## 🎯 Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Download fresh code from Figma Make
- [ ] Verify `_redirects` is a FILE (not folder with TSX files)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Wait 3 minutes
- [ ] Test: www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml shows XML
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console

---

## 📞 After You Deploy:

Tell me what you see at: www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml

- ✅ XML code → Success! Submit to Google!
- ❌ "Not Found" → Files missing, show me deployment
- ❌ HTML code → Wrong config, re-download
