# ⚡ DO THIS NOW - 2-Minute Fix!

---

## 🎯 I Found TWO Problems (Both Easy to Fix!)

---

## ✅ Problem 1: FIXED by Me

You created `_redirects` as a **folder** instead of a **file**.

**Status:** ✅ I deleted it and recreated it correctly!

---

## ⏳ Problem 2: YOU Need to Fix in Google

You submitted the **wrong sitemap name** to Google Search Console!

### What You Submitted:
```
❌ sitemap_index.xml (WRONG - this file doesn't exist!)
```

### What You Should Submit:
```
✅ sitemap.xml (CORRECT - this is your actual file!)
```

**That's why it says "Sitemap is HTML" - Google can't find the file!**

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Remove Wrong Sitemap
1. Open **Google Search Console**
2. Go to **"Sitemaps"** (left menu)
3. Find: `sitemap_index.xml`
4. Click the **❌ remove/trash icon**

### Step 2: Add Correct Sitemap
1. In the same **"Sitemaps"** section
2. Enter: **`sitemap.xml`** (just this, nothing else!)
3. Click **"Submit"**

### Step 3: Wait 5 Minutes
1. Refresh the page
2. You should now see:
   - ✅ **Status: Success**
   - ✅ **Discovered pages: 14**
   - ✅ **No more "Sitemap is HTML" error!**

---

## 📥 Step 4: Redeploy (5 Minutes)

Since I fixed the `_redirects` file, you need to redeploy:

1. **Download** updated code from Figma Make
2. **Upload/Deploy** to Vercel or Netlify
3. **Wait** 3 minutes

---

## ✅ How to Know It Worked

### In Google Search Console:
```
Before:
❌ Sitemap: sitemap_index.xml
❌ Status: Sitemap is HTML
❌ Discovered pages: 0

After:
✅ Sitemap: sitemap.xml
✅ Status: Success
✅ Discovered pages: 14
```

### Test the URL:
Visit: **`https://www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml`**

You should see XML code like:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.jioww.com/</loc>
    ...
```

**NOT** your website!
