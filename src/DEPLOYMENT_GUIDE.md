## Current Limitations in Figma Make

**Social media link previews cannot work in Figma Make** because:
- Figma Make is a client-side React environment
- Meta tags are generated by JavaScript (after page load)
- Social media crawlers need meta tags in the initial HTML (before JavaScript runs)
- Only server-side rendering can fix this

**Google Search Console indexing issues:**
- Figma Make preview URLs are temporary and should NOT be submitted to Google Search Console
- Google cannot properly index client-side React apps without server-side rendering
- Preview environments often have noindex tags or robots.txt restrictions

**Solution**: Deploy to Vercel following this guide!

---

## ✅ After Deployment - Submit to Google

Once deployed to Vercel with your custom domain:

1. **Go to Google Search Console**: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. **Add your property**: Enter your domain (e.g., jiowwglobal.com)
3. **Verify ownership**: Follow Google's verification steps
4. **Submit sitemap**: 
   - In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps"
   - Enter: `https://www.jiowwglobal.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
5. **Request indexing**:
   - Go to "URL Inspection"
   - Enter your homepage URL
   - Click "Request Indexing"

**Your site now has:**
- ✅ Proper robots meta tags (`index, follow`)
- ✅ Canonical URLs for each page
- ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD) for rich search results
- ✅ Complete sitemap.xml
- ✅ robots.txt file allowing all search engines
- ✅ SEO-optimized meta tags
- ✅ Open Graph tags for social sharing

**Indexing Timeline:**
- Google typically indexes new sites within 1-4 weeks
- Request indexing in Search Console to speed up the process
- Check "Coverage" report to see indexing status
