# 🚨 READ THIS FIRST - Critical Understanding

---

## ❌ What You Think:

"I fixed `_redirects` in Figma Make, so www.jioww.com should work now"

---

## ✅ Reality:

**Figma Make is NOT your website!**

Figma Make is a code editor. Your website is hosted on Vercel.

**You need to DEPLOY the code for changes to appear on www.jioww.com!**

---

## 📊 Current Status:

| Location | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Figma Make** | ✅ All files fixed and ready |
| **www.jioww.com** | ❌ OLD code still running |

---

## 🎯 What You MUST Do:

### 1️⃣ Download Code from Figma Make
All the fixes are ready. Download them!

### 2️⃣ Deploy to Vercel
This copies the fixed code to www.jioww.com

### 3️⃣ Test
Visit www.jioww.com/sitemap.xml - should work now!

### 4️⃣ Submit to Google
Only after test works!

---

## ⏰ How Long:

- Download: 2 minutes
- Deploy: 5 minutes  
- Test: 1 minute
- Submit to Google: 2 minutes

**Total: 10 minutes**

## 📖 Detailed Guides:

- **Quick:** Read `/DEPLOY_NOW_SIMPLE.md`
- **Detailed:** Read `/WHY_STILL_NOT_FOUND.md`
- **Google:** Read `/GOOGLE_SITEMAP_SUBMIT.txt`

---

## 🚫 STOP Doing This:

**Don't manually edit `_redirects` in Figma Make!**

You keep making it a folder instead of a file.

I've fixed it 6 times now. Just download and deploy!

---

## ✅ Bottom Line:

```
Figma Make = Workshop (where you build)
Vercel = Store (where customers see it)
Deployment = Moving from workshop to store

You built the fixes ✅
But haven't moved them to the store yet ❌
```

---

## 🚀 Action:

**Stop editing. Start deploying!**

Read `/DEPLOY_NOW_SIMPLE.md` and follow the 3 steps.

You'll have this fixed in 10 minutes! 💪

---

**The code is ready. You just need to deploy it!** ⚡
